Hi, Iâ€™m Sadegh ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Cologne, fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Aleksandar Bojchevski](https://abojchevski.github.io/). During my PhD, I completed an internship at [Axelera AI](https://axelera.ai). Before that, I worked as a research assistant at [CISPA](http://cispa.de) and completed my master's degree at [Saarland University](http://saarland-informatics-campus.de).


My current research focuses on trustworthy machine learning and efficient machine learning.

Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and new opportunitiesâ€”feel free to reach out via email!
