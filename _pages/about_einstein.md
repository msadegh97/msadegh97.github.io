Hi, Iâ€™m Sadegh ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Cologne, fortunate to be advised by Dr. Aleksandar Bojchevski. During my PhD, I completed an internship at Axelera AI. Before that, I worked as a research assistant at CISPA and completed my master's degree at Saarland University.
My current research focuses on trustworthy machine learning and efficient machine learning.
